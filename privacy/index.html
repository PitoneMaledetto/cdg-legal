  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Crypto Discipline Gate (CDG) &mdash; Version 1.1 &mdash; 14 February 2026</p>

  <div class="notice">
    CDG does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on any server. All data you
    enter stays on your device. There are no accounts, no registration, and no email required
    to use the app.
  </div>

  <h2>What this app does</h2>
  <p>
    Crypto Discipline Gate is a personal rules-tracking tool. You configure buy limits for
    Bitcoin and Ethereum; the app checks live market prices against your rules and tells you
    whether your conditions are currently met. It does not provide financial advice.
  </p>

  <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
  <p>
    The following data is stored locally using your device&rsquo;s built-in storage. It never
    leaves your device except as described under &ldquo;Third-party services&rdquo; below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your configuration</strong> &mdash; maximum exposure and buy size settings for BTC and ETH.</li>
    <li><strong>Your buy records</strong> &mdash; dates, amounts, and prices of purchases you manually confirm in the app. These are entered by you and stored only on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Gate state</strong> &mdash; total invested per asset, last buy date, last buy price, and the date your maximum was first reached. Used to evaluate your configured rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Market data cache</strong> &mdash; the most recently fetched BTC and ETH prices, stored temporarily to avoid unnecessary network requests. Treated as unavailable after 15 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Disclaimer acknowledgement</strong> &mdash; the date and version of the disclaimer you accepted during onboarding.</li>
  <p>
    None of this data is linked to your identity. The app has no user accounts and no
    mechanism to associate stored data with any individual.
  </p>

  <h2>Data the app does not collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No name, email address, or contact information</li>
    <li>No location data</li>
    <li>No device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
    <li>No usage analytics or behavioural tracking</li>
    <li>No crash reports transmitted to any server</li>
    <li>No payment card details or financial account information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    The app makes outbound network requests to one external services. Your
    device&rsquo;s IP address is included in the request as a standard part of how internet
    connections work. CDG has no control over how these services handle that information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CoinGecko</strong><br />
    CDG fetches live Bitcoin and Ethereum price data from CoinGecko&rsquo;s public API. No
    personal data is sent in these requests &mdash; the app asks only for market prices. CDG
    makes no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of data returned by
    CoinGecko.
    The app retrieves public market data from CoinGecko via secure HTTPS requests. No personal data is transmitted.
    CoinGecko&rsquo;s own privacy policy governs their data practices:
    <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coingecko.com/en/privacy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    CDG does not sell, rent, or share any data with any third party. There is no advertising
    network, no analytics provider, and no backend server operated by CDG.
  </p>

  <h2>California residents (CCPA)</h2>
  <p>
    CDG does not sell personal information. CDG does not share personal
    information with third parties for cross-context behavioural advertising.
    California residents have the right to know what personal information is
    collected, to request deletion, and to opt out of sale. Because CDG
    collects no personal information, there is nothing to disclose, delete,
    or opt out of — but we are required to acknowledge these rights.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>
    All data is stored on your device and remains there until you delete the app. Deleting the
    app removes all locally stored data. There is no server-side data to request deletion of,
    because no data is ever sent to CDG&rsquo;s servers (CDG operates no servers).
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    CDG is not directed at children. The minimum age to use this app is 13
    (in line with COPPA for US users), 16 (in line with EU GDPR Article 8
    defaults for most EU member states), or such higher age as applies in
    your jurisdiction. Finance category apps referencing real-currency
    investment activity are rated 17+ on iOS and 18+ on Android. We do not
    knowingly collect any data from anyone below the applicable minimum age.
  </p>

  <h2>Your rights (UK and EEA users)</h2>
  <p>
    Because CDG collects no personal data and operates no servers, the rights
    granted under the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, and equivalent data protection legislation
    &mdash; including access, rectification, erasure, portability, and objection &mdash;
    are exercised directly on your device by managing or deleting the app.
    There is no data held elsewhere to request.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this, contact us at the address below.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes, the updated version will be published at this URL with a revised
    date. We will also update the version shown in the app. Continued use of the app after a
    policy update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
